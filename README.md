Pharma Drug Sales Dashboard and Insights with Power BI:

The pharmaceutical industry plays a critical role in healthcare, and analyzing sales data can help uncover trends, performance gaps, and opportunities. This project focuses on **exploring and analyzing a pharma drug sales dataset** using Microsoft Power BI. The dataset contains detailed information about drug categories, units sold, sales performance, and time-based attributes such as date, month, hour, and quarter.


Project Objective:

- Visualize the drug sales data interactively
- Understand sales performance over different time periods
- Identify top-selling drug categories
- Provide actionable business insights for stakeholders


Business Insights from the Dashboard:

- The analysis revealed that N02BE is the top-selling drug category based on weekly sales performance, while the month of October consistently recorded the highest sales throughout the observed years. Quarterly analysis showed that Q1 and Q4 were the strongest periods for overall sales.
- Interestingly, the category M01AE emerged as a major contributor, accounting for nearly 50% of total daily sales, making it a critical driver of revenue. Hourly trends highlighted specific peak periods during the day where sales volume was significantly higher. 
- In terms of long-term performance, sales growth showed a positive trend between 2014 and 2017, although there were slight dips in subsequent years. The dashboard includes interactive filters that allow users to slice the data by year and drug category, enabling deeper drill-down analysis and actionable insights.
